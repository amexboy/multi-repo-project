# Intellij Project Generator 

When working on multi-repositories, it can often be hard to switch context(switching between tasks) that use the same repository.

The project is cli tool to generate separate Intellij IDEA with only a set of modules (repositories). It creates a new git-worktree
for each of the repositories and enables you to work on multiple tasks independently without issues.
